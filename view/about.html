                    I've made videos, produced music, edited images (including these), written stories, and drawn things.
                    On a computer. Because it's the twenty-first century and stuff (except I like drawing on paper with a pencil).
                    I'm trying to get into music production because awesome people produce music.
                    I also know how to use CAD software, if what's being made needs to be physical one day.

                    Knowledge of several programming languages, paradigms, and problem solving strategies.
                    I use computers to make things happen and it makes me happy to do so!
                    Websites, applications, games, math problems, whatever you like, I'm down for it!
                    <br>My resume is on my LinkedIn, if you wanna know.

                    You probably know that already if you follow me on social media.
                    You gotta do things when they need doing, but even so, life is meant to be enjoyed. I try to enjoy mine!
                    I'm easy to please, so I like some dumb things, but I have my, albeit very subjective and personal, reasons.
                    Independent media, like music, games, and comics, makes me happy because it's usually made by creative, real humans who love what they do.
                    I try to love my fellow humans as best I am able while on the planet we share.
